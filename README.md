# Advent of Code 2015

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by **stars**, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect **fifty** stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
